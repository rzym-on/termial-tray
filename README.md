## Background
I really like new Windows Terminal but before I was using ConEmu - It's really nice, easy to use yet powerfull. I really like Quake Style behavior in ConEmu - app *lives in tray* and app window with my terminals appear only when I press some ShortKey (in my case *LAlt + \`*). By hiding and showing terminals window I could switch between other windows using Alt+Tab, go to other [workspaces](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/using-workspaces) using `Win+Ctrl+LArrow/RArrow` and call my terminals when and where I wanted. 

I fell in love with new Windows Terminal, but didn't find any solution to *"store app in tray"* - hide terminals window, and call it using ShortKeys. I found some applications, but they were too big for my needs. So I wrote this little app, to resolve my problem. And here we are. For now **Termial Tray** is everything that I wanted. Maybe in the future MS add this *Quake Style* feature to Windows Terminal, but for now this little tray app is enough for me. And I hope that'll be enough for you too.

## Features

### **Access from multiple workspaces**
You can show your app on all of your workspaces, do something, hide it, go to oher workspace and pull the same app from system tray.

### **Run an app if it's not started**
When Termial Tray starts, it's not starting apps, that you defined in code - it's waiting for Hot Keys. After HotKeys is pressed, Termial Tray look if a process is already running and attaches it to HotKeys (One process, one window, one hotkey). If app is not running - it start an app for you and attach this process to HotKeys. If you close your app, and press HotKeys again, Termial Tray will start new app, and it'll attach to it.

### **Apps run in background**
When you run something in app, that is attached to Termial Tray - it'll continue its work when it's hidden.

### **Works with not-attached apps**
If you had multiple instances of an app, Termial Tray will store only one, so fe. you could have multiple windows with terminals, and one **floating** terminal that you can pull anywhere.

## FAQ

### **Can I manage other apps like Windows Terminal with Quake Style?**
You can configure settings by `config.json` like below.

#### config.json
```json
{
    "Apps": [
        {
            "ProcessName": "WindowsTerminal",
            "ExeFilePath": "wt.exe",
            "ModifierKeys": 1,
            "Keys": 84
        },
        {
            "ProcessName": "Spotify",
            "ExeFilePath": "Spotify.exe",
            "ModifierKeys": 1,
            "Keys": 83
        }
    ]
}
```
The json should be located at:
1. same directory as `WindowsTermialTray.exe`
1. `$env:LOCALAPPDATA\WindowsTermialTray\config.json`

From here you can add other apps, but you need to specify and know:

* Your app [ProcessName](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/get-process?view=powershell-7).
* Your app executable.
* Unique pair of `ModifierKey` and [Key](https://docs.microsoft.com/ja-jp/dotnet/api/system.windows.forms.keys).
#### ModifierKey
- Alt: 1
- Control: 2
- Shift: 4
- Win: 8

### **Will you be contributing this Termial Tray?**
Nah. I hope that MS add *Quake Style* behaviour for Windows Terminal, but if not, or some people find Termial Tray useful for other Jobs - I'll start to work on this app, to make it more powerfull and usefull.

### **Your code is a mess, shame on you**
Thanks for your opinion! I'm not an expert in .NET and this kind of system apps - I created this to fit my personal needs and added it here for people (if they want to benefit from this solution). But if you're expert, please share your opinion about this project with me - I'll fix and update code to be clean and fast.
